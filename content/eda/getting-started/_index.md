## What are Event Driven Architectures ?
Event-driven architectures are a design paradigm that employs events and asynchronous communication to loosely couple an applicationâ€™s components. These architectures can enhance agility and aid in the construction of reliable, scalable applications.

Serverless services such as Azure Event Grid, Azure Logic Apps,Azure Container Apps, Azure Service Bus, Azure Event Hubs, and Azure Functions align naturally with event-driven architectures - they are triggered by events, emit events, and possess inherent capabilities for building with events.

This guide introduces you with event-driven architectures. Comprehend the patterns within event-driven architectures and the Azure services that are frequently used to implement them. Learn best practices for constructing event-driven architectures, from designing event schemas to managing idempotency. Discover resources to get started with building event-driven architectures on Azure.

## What serverless services can you use to build event-driven architectures?
