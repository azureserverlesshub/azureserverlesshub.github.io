These architectures can enhance agility and aid in the construction of reliable, scalable applications.\nServerless services such as Azure Event Grid, Azure Logic Apps,Azure Container Apps, Azure Service Bus, Azure Event Hubs, and Azure Functions align naturally with event-driven architectures - they are triggered by events, emit events, and possess inherent capabilities for building with events.\nThis guide introduces you with event-driven architectures. Comprehend the patterns within event-driven architectures and the Azure services that are frequently used to implement them. Learn best practices for constructing event-driven architectures, from designing event schemas to managing idempotency. Discover resources to get started with building event-driven architectures on Azure.\nWhat serverless services can you use to build event-driven architectures?\rIcon-compute-29\rAzure Functions\rAzure Functions is a serverless solution that allows you to write less code, maintain less infrastructure, and save on costs. Instead of worrying about deploying and maintaining servers, the cloud infrastructure provides all the up-to-date resources needed to keep your applications running.\nPatternsLearn More\rAzure Logic Apps\rAzure Logic Apps is a cloud platform where you can create and run automated workflows with little to no code. By using the visual designer and selecting from prebuilt operations, you can quickly build a workflow that integrates and manages your apps, data, services, and systems.\nPatternsLearn More\rAzure Container Apps\rAzure Container Apps is a serverless platform that allows you to maintain less infrastructure and save costs while running containerized applications. Instead of worrying about server configuration, container orchestration, and deployment details, Container Apps provides all the up-to-date server resources required to keep your applications stable and secure.\nPatternsLearn More"},"title":"_index"},"/eda/visuals/":{"data":{"":"Small bite sized visuals about event-driven architectures.\nDesigns and random thoughts from @boyney123 and recreated by @ankt_srkr whereever needed.\nProducer and consumer responsibilitiesSet clear responsibility for producers \u0026 consumers"},"title":"_index"},"/eda/visuals/producer-consumer-responsibilities/":{"data":{"":"When building event-driven applications itâ€™s important to know the responsibility of the consumer and producer.\nProducer and Consumer Responsibilities\rUse this diagram as a base, but you may want to adapt it based on your architecture."},"title":"Producer and consumer responsibilities"},"/patterns/":{"data":{"":"ðŸ‘‹ Hello!
